         This script was developed by Isabela Almeida          
 in order to remove the probes that overlap for up to n
 positions to the previous one, given a .bed file input.       
 
 This was created while I was a MSc Bioinformatics student at  
 the Universidade de SÃ£o Paulo (USP/Brazil) under supervision  
 of USP PhD Prof. Maria Vibranovski and under co-supervion of  
 UFRJ PhD Prof. Bernardo de Carvalho in the year of 2020
